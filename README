defuzz : a lightweight icecast streaming client written in python


# 1. Introduction
# ===============

DeFuzz is a light python program that streams media data from disks to icecast2
with some metadata. It supports MP3, OGG, SPEEX and THEORA media.

It is neccessary to provide a config file which sets all needed parameters
(see example/myfuzz.xml for example).


# 2. Installation
# ===============

see INSTALL


# 3. License
# ===============

 This software is licensed as described in the file COPYING, which
 you should have received as part of this distribution. The terms
 are also available at http://svn.parisson.org/defuzz/DeFuzzLicense


# 4. Usage
# =========

Usage : defuzz CONFIGFILE
  
  where CONFIGFILE is the path for a XML config file
  ex: defuzz ./myfuzz.xml

Note that you must edit the config file with right parameters before executing...
You can find an example for the XML file in the directory "example/" of this
application.

Be carefull : at the moment the Thread implementation raises exceptions when
shutting down with CTRL + C...
You have then to kill each stream manually or make a full `pkill defuzz` .

# 6. Aknowledgements
# ==================

This work is inspired by the great - C - Oddsock's streaming program : Ezstream.
Since I needed to patch it in order to modify the playlist (randomize for example)
and make external batch tools to create multiple channels, I decided to rewrite it
from scratch in python.
Some parts of this work are also taken from another Parisson's project : Telemeta
(see http://svn.parisson.org/telemeta).
