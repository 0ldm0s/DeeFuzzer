deefuzz : an easy and light media streaming tool


# 1. Introduction
# ===============

DeeFuzz is a light python program that streams media data from file systems to icecast2
with the metadata. It supports MP3, OGG, SPEEX and THEORA media.

It is neccessary to provide a config file which sets all needed parameters
(see example/myfuzz.xml for example).


# 2. Installation
# ===============

see INSTALL


# 3. License
# ===============

 This software is licensed as described in the file COPYING, which
 you should have received as part of this distribution. The terms
 are also available at http://svn.parisson.org/deefuzz/DeeFuzzLicense


# 4. Usage
# =========

Usage : deefuzz CONFIGFILE
  
  where CONFIGFILE is the path for a XML config file. For example:

    $ deefuzz example/myfuzz.xml

Note that you must edit the config file with right parameters before executing.
You can find an example for the XML file in the directory "example/" of this
application (maybe in /usr/share/deefuzz if installed with the help of install.py)

DeeFuzz can also be run as a deamon using deefuzz-deamon:

    $ deefuzz-deamon example/myfuzz.xml &

Since 0.3, deefuzz doesn't print anything into the shell, then a right <log> parameter
is needed in the XML config file.

BE CAREFULL : at the moment, the multi-threading implementation of deefuzz instances
avoids to shut down the streams with CTRL+C... You have to kill them manually,
after a CTRL+Z, making this:

    $ kill -9 `pgrep deefuzz`

# 6. Aknowledgements
# ==================

This work is inspired by the great - C - Oddsock's streaming program : Ezstream.
Since I needed to patch it in order to modify the playlist (randomize for example)
and make external batch tools to create multiple channels, I decided to rewrite it
from scratch in python.
Some parts of this work are also taken from another Parisson's project : Telemeta
(see http://svn.parisson.org/telemeta).
