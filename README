D-Fuzz is a light python program that streams media data from disks to icecast2 with some metadata. It supports MP3, OGG, SPEEX and THEORA media.

It is neccessary to provide a config file which sets all needed parameters (see myfuzz.xml for example).

# 6. Aknowledgements
# ==================

This work is inspired by the great - C - Oddsock's streaming program : Ezstream.
Since I needed to patch it in order to modify the playlist (randomize for example) and make external batch tools to create multiple channels, I decided to rewrite it from scratch in python. Some parts of this work are also taken from another Parisson's project : Telemeta (see http://svn.parisson.org/telemeta).
